		  <h2>What is a (CVV) Credit Card Code?</h2>
		  <p>For Visa and MasterCard cards, the card code is the last 3 digit number located on the back 
		  of your card on or above your signature line. </p>
		  <p>To help reduce fraud in the card-not-present environment, 
		  credit card companies have introduced a card code program. 
		  Visa calls this code Card Verification Value (CVV); MasterCard calls it Card Validation Code (CVC). 
		  The card code is a three- or four- digit security code that is printed on the back of cards. 
		  The number typically appears at the end of the signature panel.</p>
