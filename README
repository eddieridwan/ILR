== ILR

Setup =======

Rails 2.3.11
Requires patch to fix problems with cookies and redirects when running on Mongrel 1.1.5.
The patch is at https://gist.github.com/826692 => config/initializers/mongrel.rb
See also the following discussion thread: https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/4690


The git repository is at https://github.com/eddieridwan/ILR

Deploy ======

Hosted at https://ns40.mochahost.com:2083/, basic shared hosting service.
Deploy using FTP
There is no ssh or command line access. So have to manually create the database using
cpanel Mysql facilities.

For the mochahost production environment, must also freeze rails (rake rails:freeze:gems) to vendor/rails to patch a problem with 
loading gems: http://betterlogic.com/roger/2011/05/undefined-method/. i.e. make changes to gem_dependency.rb
FTP vendor/rails if changes are required to rails.

For the mochahost production environment, must also unpack any gems to vendor/gems. To unpack the gems run
  rake gems:unpack:dependencies GEM=gem_name
in the rails shell in Aptana Studio. This rake command does not seem to work in git bash.
When adding new gems remember to unpack the gems and FTP vendor/gems 

To migrate databases:
1. export production database from phpMysqladmin (mysqldump)
2. import the database dumpfile: mysql dumpfile < local database
3. set database.yml to point to the imported local database
4. rake db:migrate the new database (if necessary, change the version in the schema_migrations table)
5. mysqldump new database > database dump to publish to mochahost
6. in mochahost import the database dump to a new server database (or existing A|B database)
7. create (or edit existing A|B) ilr app to point to the new server database
8. test and then switch to become the main languagetechnologies.com app

Point http://languagetechnologies.com to the new ilr app.
Do this using the RoR url rewrite facility on the mochahost cpanel.
May also need to edit the .htaccess file in the public_html folder as the domain may still be pointing to the old ilr app.


TODO ====================
1. Find out a way to use bundler on mochahost, pointing to gems in /home/eddier/ruby/gems
2. Or find out a way to load gems from /home/eddier/ruby/gems
