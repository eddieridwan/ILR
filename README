== ILR

Setup =======

Rails 2.3.11
Requires patch to fix problems with cookies and redirects when running on Mongrel 1.1.5.
The patch is at https://gist.github.com/826692 => config/initializers/mongrel.rb
See also the following discussion thread: https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/4690

The git repository is at https://github.com/eddieridwan/ILR

Deploy ======

Hosted at https://ns40.mochahost.com:2083/, basic shared hosting service.
Deploy using FTP
There is no ssh or command line access. So have to manually create the database using
cpanel Mysql facilities.

Todo: look at ways to make db changes locally and then push to the server.
